## Description
I was downloadingÂ _Never Gonna Give You Up_, but instead, I got this bizarre audio file. At first, I thought it was corrupted, but there seems to be more to it. Something about the spectrum feels... off. Can you figure out the hidden message?

## Given Files
![[chall.wav]]

## Solution
The description hints about spectrum.
I opened the file in Audacity and changed the view to Spectrogram.
Then adjusted the tempo to make the flag visible.
