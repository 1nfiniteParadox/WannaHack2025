## Solution
Malicious software that disguises itself as a legitimate program is called aÂ Trojan.

The type of malware that replicates itself to infect other files on a system is called a **virus**.

Ransomware encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and then demands a payment (ransom) in exchange for the decryption key.
